# BVV Berlin
## Streamlit App

### Project Overview
The ALLRIS interface (General Council Information System) is used by many local authorities in Germany for council and meeting management in order to manage information on political bodies, committees, meetings and resolutions and make it publicly accessible. The open data can be retrieved and further processed via the API in the OPARL standard. This BVV-App uses the district council data of the 12 Berlin districts and provides an overview of the committees and parliamentary groups as well as the current district representatives and their roles. It also visualises the development of gender distribution within the district councils over time. An integrated keyword search makes it easier to find meetings with specific agenda items - provided that the districts make this information available.

### Prerequisites
